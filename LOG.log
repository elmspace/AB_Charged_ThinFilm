The code at the moment compiles. I have written a few Mod files to do calculations for different combination of parameters.
They compile, but I need to make sure that in the long run they produce the correct the results.
I will be doing some testing now.

Still have not solved the problem. I am comparing the MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_PA results with the previous calculations and they do not match exactly.

Looking to find why they donâ€™t match.
doing more tests.

Still getting weird results.
I think the problem is with the Box minimization algorithm.
The problem is that the free energy depends on where we start from, V=0 or some V=v, this should not be the case.
I will be looking into that, and be doing some testing with that.

I fixed the main problem.
The problem was that if PA is changing, since pIave depends on PA, then pIave should also be updated.
The problem with the start position is still there, although it is minor now.
Will look into fixing the problem completely.
Also, I will write a function for finding the intersection between the deltafE and the f(x)=0 to find an accurate V_critical.
I have written the function, testing it now.
It works perfectly.  :)

Will be commiting all the changes so far and pushing it to GitHub.
I will pull it to SHARCNET and will run some jobs over night.
